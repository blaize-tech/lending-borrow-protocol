# Tokenomics

## **Introduction**

The heart of the OMOMO ecosystem is dToken â€“ the native utility token of the protocol. It will enable two key utility cases: incentivization and DAO governance.

## **Token utility**

dToken is used as an internal asset to get access to the full functionality of the OMOMO platform. This includes depositing and borrowing funds, withdrawing assets, repaying loans, etc.

#### dToken utility:

* collateral;
* repayment method;
* depositors incentivisation;
* borrowers incentivization;
* service roles incentivization;
* DAO governance.
