# Tokenomics

NEARLAND protocol will have native token which is aimed to be integrated into the protocol with several utilities:
* initial incentivization for the newly created supply/borrow markets
* DAO and vote power for each token
* utility for custom user's operations: for custom markets creation, custom profitable interest models integration
* utility for the service roles of the protocol: price feeds update, liquidity active management, new profitable DeFi strategies integration
* token burn for the prioritized operations: safe protection from early liquidation (notifications about risk of the loan, protection from the liquidation a.k.a. prolongation of the loan)
* token burn for the support of automatic liquidations and support of individual automated workers by the chosen liquidation strategies
* additional colalterization by the native token
