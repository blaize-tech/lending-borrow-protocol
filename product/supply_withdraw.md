# Deposit & Earning

## How do I deposit

Before you want to make a deposit, you should connect a wallet. You can do it via the "Connect wallet" button on the main page of the application. After, please find an asset that you wanna supply and click "Supply", select the amount you'd like to deposit in an appeared modal window and submit your transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed, your deposit is successfully registered and you begin earning interest.

## What's the profit ?

Once your deposit will be supplied, your account will be rewarded by `dTokens`. `dTokens` holders receive continuous earnings that evolve with market conditions. You can look at the Interest Model category to find out how does it work more precisely.

Also, after the native token integration and DAO implementation, the protocol with provide incentivisation for the market supply, thus encouraging user to provide the liquidity.

At later stages the prtocol will provide user the instrumentary for most important operations:
* custom markets creation and supply
* active management of the user's liquidity - choose by yourself the way the liquidity should work
