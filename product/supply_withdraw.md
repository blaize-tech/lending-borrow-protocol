# Deposit & Earning

## How do I deposit

1. Connect your wallet by clicking on the Connect Wallet button on the main page of the application.
2. Find an asset youâ€™d like to supply and click the Supply button. Then, select the amount you wish to deposit in a pop-up window and submit your transaction.
3. Once the transaction is confirmed, your deposit is successfully registered, and you start earning interest on the supplied amount.

## How do I earn?

Once your deposit is registered and supplied, you start getting rewards in dTokens.

All dTokens holders receive incentives that evolve with market conditions. You can learn more about incentivization and earning interest with OMOMO in the Interest Rate Model chapter.

## **Is there any minimum or maximum limit to deposit?**

You can deposit any amount you want, there are no limits. Still, it's important to keep in mind potential transaction fees that will directly influence your deposit amount and final earnings. We highly recommend you consider this when depositing low amounts since transaction fees might be higher than the expected earnings, and your deposit may lose its value.

## **How can I withdraw?**

## Can I use my assets as collateral?
