# Borrow

## Borrow vs Withdraw

Withdrawing your assets means closing your position on that particular asset. Let's imagine, if you are long on the asset, you would not be entitled to the potential upside value gain. By borrowing you are able to obtain liquidity (working capital) without selling your assets.

## How do I borrow?

For borrowing action you need to supply any asset to be used as collateral. After this, click on `Borrow` button for the asset you want to interact. Set the amount in `Borrow` tab, based on your available supplies that would be used as a collateral for the loan and confirm your transaction.
